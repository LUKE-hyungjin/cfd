# Fluid Mechanics

Fundamental principles and equations governing fluid motion.

## Learning Path

1. [What is a Fluid](/en/docs/fundamentals/fluid-mechanics/what-is-fluid) - Definition and properties
2. [Continuity Equation](/en/docs/fundamentals/fluid-mechanics/continuity) - Conservation of mass
3. [Navier-Stokes Equations](/en/docs/fundamentals/fluid-mechanics/navier-stokes) - The heart of CFD
4. [Laminar and Turbulent Flow](/en/docs/fundamentals/fluid-mechanics/laminar-turbulent) - Two flow patterns
5. [Boundary Layer](/en/docs/fundamentals/fluid-mechanics/boundary-layer) - Flow near walls

## Why Learn This?

CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulates fluid flow using computers. To run simulations, you must first understand **what laws fluids follow**.

Just as you can't make a car game without knowing how cars move, you can't do CFD without knowing how fluids move.
